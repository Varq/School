Hello, this is a test.
This test is for a computer science assignment.
The requirments for the assignment included keyboard input.
I wonder if this is working properly
Whoops, I forgot a period, I guess it's not a big deal.
How much more am I supposed to write?
I think about 6 or so more lines.
It's getting pretty close to the end here.
Let's sing a song to pass the time.
Row, row, row your boat~
Gently down the stream~
Merrily, Merrily, Merrily, Merrily~
Life is but a dream~
This should be enough! Good bye~
