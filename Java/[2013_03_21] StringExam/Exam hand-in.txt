 * This program can analyze an input text file by:
 * -Finding and storing the shortest and longest line by
 *   number of characters
 * -Counting the number of characters, words, and blocks
 *   (A block is 512 bytes)
 * 
 * This program can also output an edited input text file
 *   with the following edits:
 * -Capitalize the first letter of each line
 * -Remove multiple adjacent spaces
